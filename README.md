SingularityNET Daemon
The daemon is the adapter with which an otherwise SingularityNET-unaware service implementation can be exposed to the SingularityNET platform. It is designed to be deployed as a sidecar proxy alongside the service on a given host.
The daemon abstracts the blockchain components away from the clients.
The SNET Daemon interacts with the Multi Party Escrow to facilitate authorization and payment for services and acts as a passthrough for making API calls to the service.The daemon is the endpoint a client will submit requests to, and they are then passed to the service after validation by the daemon.


## Channel Claim command
Gets the latest channel state of the Channel updated in ETCD by the daemons of the same group and then increments the nonce of the channel.
It then sends and ON-Chain transaction to claim funds.The daemons continue their work independently without any confirmation from the treasurer on the blockchain.


## Development

These instructions are intended to facilitate the development and testing of SingularityNET Daemon. Users interested in
deploying SingularityNET services using SingularityNET Daemon should install the appropriate binary as
[released](#release).

### Prerequisites

* [Go 1.21+](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [Node 8+ w/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Dependencies

* install [Protoc 3.0+](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1072683/how-can-i-install-protoc-on-ubuntu-16-04) 

* If you want to cross-compile you will also need Docker

### Installing

* Clone the git repository to the following path $GOPATH/src/github.com/singnet/
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:singnet/snet-daemon.git
$ cd snet-daemon
```

* Install development/test dependencies
```bash
$ ./scripts/install
```

* Build snet-daemon (on Linux amd64 platform), see below section if you want to cross compile instead.
Please note using ldflags, the latest tagged version , sha1 revision and the build time are set as part of the build.
You need to pass the version as shown in the example below 
```bash
$ ./scripts/build linux amd64 <version>
```

* Generate default config file  snet-daemon (on Linux amd64 platform)
```bash
$ ./build/snetd-linux-amd64 init 
```
**** Please update the registry address in daemon config based on the test network used 

#### Cross-compiling

If you want to build snetd for platforms other than the one you are on, run `./scripts/build-xgo` instead of `./scripts/build`.

You can edit the script to choose a specific platform, but by default it will build for Linux, OSX, and Windows (amd64 for all, except Linux which will also build for arm6)

Please note using ldflags the latest tagged version (passed as the first parameter to the script) , sha1 revision and the build time are set as part of the build.

```bash
$ ./scripts/build-xgo <version>
```

#### Run Deamon
```bash
$ ../build/snetd-linux-amd64
```

### Signatures in Daemon 
[Payment](/escrow/README.md).

### Configuration

Configuration file is a main source of the configuration. Some properties
can be set via environment variables or command line parameters see [table
below](#environment-variables-and-cli-parameters). Use `--config`
parameter with any command to set configuration file name.  By default daemon
use configuration file in JSON format `snetd.config.json` but other formats are
also supported via [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper). Use `snet init`
command to save configuration file with default values. Following
configuration properties can be set using configuration file.

#### Main properties

These properties you should usually change before starting daemon for the first
time.
* **blockchain_network_selected**  (required)
  Name of the network to be used for Daemon possible values are one of (kovan,ropsten,main,local or rinkeby).
  Daemon will automatically read the Registry address associated with this network For local network ( you can also specify the registry address manually),see the blockchain_network_config.json

* **daemon_type** (required;) -
  Defines the type of service. Available values :`grpc, jsonrpc, http, process`.

* **service_credentials** (optional, if daemon_type = http):

"location": "header"}]
```
Location can be: query or header

* **daemon_end_point** (required;) - 
Defines the ip and the port on which the daemon listens to.
format is :`<host>:<port>`.

* **ethereum_json_rpc_endpoint** (optional, default: `"http://127.0.0.1:8545"`) -
endpoint to which daemon sends ethereum JSON-RPC requests; 
Based on the network selected blockchain_network_selected the end point is auto determined
Example `"https://kovan.infura.io"` for kovan testnet.

path to executable to expose as a service.


#### Other properties

This options are less frequently needed.

* **allowed_users_flag** (optional;default:`false`) - You may need to protect the service provider 's service in test environment from being called by anyone, only Authorized users can make calls , when this flag is defined in the config, you can enforce this behaviour.You cannot set this flag to true 
  in mainnet.  
  This config is applicable only when you have the value to true.
  In which case it becomes mandatory to define the configuration `allowed_users`,

* **allowed_user_addresses** (optional;) - List of selected user addresses who can make requests to Daemon
  Is Applicable only when you have `allowed_users_flag set` to true.

It is not recommended to set the value more than 4GB
`Please make sure your grpc version > 1.25` 

* **metering_enabled** (optional,default: `false`) -
This is used to define if metering needs to be enabled or not .You will need to define a valid ` metering_end_point`
