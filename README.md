Users interested in deploying SingularityNET services should use this daemon

The daemon is the adapter with which an otherwise SingularityNET-unaware service implementation can be exposed to the
SingularityNET platform. It is designed to be deployed as a sidecar proxy alongside the service on a given host.
The daemon abstracts the blockchain components away from the clients.
The SNET Daemon interacts with the Multi Party Escrow to facilitate authorization and payment for services and acts as a
passthrough for making API calls to the service. The daemon is the endpoint a client will submit requests to, and they
are then passed to the service after validation by the daemon.

## Install and use <a name="use"></a>

Precompiled binaries are published with each release,
download [from releases page](https://github.com/singnet/snet-daemon/releases) or use terminal:

```bash
curl -LJO https://github.com/singnet/snet-daemon/releases/download/v6.0.0/snetd-linux-amd64-v6.0.0
chmod +x snetd-linux-amd64-v6.0.0 
```

#### Generate basic config file

For most users, a simple config is enough:

```bash
./snetd-linux-amd64-v6.0.0 init 
```

This command will generate a file `snetd.config.json` in which you will need to
change [some parameters](#main_properties).

#### Generate default full config file

```bash
./snetd-linux-amd64-v6.0.0 init-full
```

#### Run Daemon

```bash
./snetd-linux-amd64-v6.0.0
```

Specifying the path to the config using the '-c' argument:

```bash
./snetd-linux-amd64-v6.0.0 -c name_of_config.json
```

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

Configuration file is a main source of the configuration. Some properties
can be set via environment variables or command line parameters see [table
below](#table_conf). Use `--config` parameter with any command to set configuration file name. By default daemon
use configuration file in JSON format `snetd.config.json` but other formats are
also supported via [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper). Use `init-full` or `init`
command to save configuration file with default values. The following configuration properties can be set using a
configuration file.

### Main properties <a name="main_properties"></a>

These properties you should usually change before starting daemon for the first
time.

* **blockchain_network_selected** (required, default `"sepolia"`)
  Name of the network to be used for Daemon possible values are one of (sepolia, main, goerli, local).
  Daemon will automatically read the Registry address associated with this network For local network ( you can also
  specify the registry address manually), see the blockchain_network_config.json

* **daemon_endpoint** (required, default `"127.0.0.1:8080"`) —
  Defines the ip and the port on which the daemon listens to.
  format is :`<host>:<port>`.

* **ethereum_json_rpc_http_endpoint** (optional, default: `"https://sepolia.infura.io/v3"`) —
  endpoint to which daemon sends ethereum JSON-RPC requests;
  Based on the network selected blockchain_network_selected the end point is auto determined
  Example `"https://sepolia.infura.io/v3"` for sepolia testnet.

* **blockchain_provider_api_key** (optional, default: `""`) — basic header authorization key for blockchain providers.
  Tested with
  [infura api key secret](https://docs.infura.io/dashboard/secure-an-api/api-key-secret).

  Id of the service to search for [service configuration
  metadata][service-configuration-metadata].

* **passthrough_enabled** (optional; default: `true`) —
  when passthrough is disabled, daemon echoes requests back as responses; `false`
  reserved mostly for testing purposes.

* **service_endpoint** (required except service_type `executable`; default: `http://localhost:5000`) —
  endpoint to which requests should be proxied for handling by service.
  This config is mandatory when `passthrough_enabled` is set to true.
  and needs to be a valid url

* **executable_path** (required if `service_type` is `executable`) —
  path to executable to expose as a service.

* **ipfs_endpoint** (optional; default `"https://ipfs.singularitynet.io:443"`) —

* **trusted_free_call_signers** (optional, default SingularityNET addresses) — A list of trusted public addresses that
  are allowed to issue free call tokens on your behalf (e.g. trusted centralized backends or marketplaces).

  ⚠️ If this field is left empty, free calls will not work via the SingularityNET Marketplace, but will still be
  available for clients using the Web3 approach (e.g., via SDKs).

  ```json
  "trusted_free_call_signers": [
  "0x7DF35C98f41F3Af0df1dc4c7F7D4C19a71Dd059F",

  It is not recommended to set the value more than 4GB
  `Please make sure your grpc version > 1.25`

* **metering_enabled** (optional, default: `false`) —
  This is used to define if metering needs to be enabled or not .You will need to define a valid ` metering_endpoint`

  latest Channel Status is published, this way the offline channel state balance can also be tracked.
  Daemon will send a signature signed by this private key, metering service will already have the public key
  corresponding
  to this Daemon, metering service will ensure that the signer it receives matches the public key configured at its end.
  This is mandatory only when metering is enabled.

## Channel Claim and other commands <a name="commands"></a>

Gets the latest channel state of the Channel updated in ETCD by the daemons of the same group and then increments the
nonce of the channel.
It then sends and ON-Chain transaction to claim funds. The daemons continue their work independently without any
confirmation from the treasurer on the blockchain.

**Claim funds from the channel**

Refer to the link below on an end to
end [Example of MPE](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/tree/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples)
At the moment treasurer server is a part of snet-daemon command line interface.

```bash
./snetd-linux-amd64-v6.0.0 claim --channel-id 0
```

## Build & Development <a name="build"></a>

These instructions are intended to facilitate the development and testing of SingularityNET Daemon.

### Prerequisites and dependencies

* [Go 1.23+](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [Protoc 27.0+](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)

**Protoc (libprotoc), golang and $GOPATH/bin are recommended to be in environment variables.**

### Installing

* Clone the git repository (for example, $GOPATH/src/github.com/singnet/)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:singnet/snet-daemon.git
cd snet-daemon
```

**Install dependencies and generate bindings**

Bash

```bash
./scripts/install_deps
```

PowerShell

```powershell
./scripts/powershell/install_deps.ps1
```

**Build snet-daemon**. Please note using ldflags, the latest tagged version, sha1 revision and the build time are set as
part of the build. You need to pass the version as shown in the example below:

```bash
./scripts/build <linux/windows/darwin> <amd64/arm/arm64> <version>
```

**Examples**

Bash:

```bash
./scripts/build linux amd64 v6.0.0
```

Powershell:

```powershell
./scripts/powershell/build.ps1 linux amd64 v6.0.0
```

The final binaries will be in the `/build` folder.

#### Multi-compiling

If you want to build daemon for several platforms, run `./scripts/build-all <version>` instead
of `./scripts/build`.

You can edit the script to choose the specific platforms, but by default it will build for Linux, Darwin (OSX), and
Windows.

#### Unit Testing

```bash
./scripts/test
``` 

or

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Fixing errors

If daemon panic with `panic: proto: file "record.proto" is already registered`
you should set environment var `GOLANG_PROTOBUF_REGISTRATION_CONFLICT=warn`

### Blockchain network config

You can edit `ethereum_json_rpc_http_endpoint` in `resources/blockchain_network_config.json` before ./scripts/build.

### Signatures in Daemon

* [Payment Signatures](/escrow/README.md).
